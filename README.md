## Contributing

To contribute, work on the source files. Then build and run the tests against the built files. Be careful to not introduce syntax that will be transpiled down to unsupported syntax. For example, `for...of` loops will be transpiled to use `Symbol.iterator` which is unavailable in IE.

### Build scripts

#### `npm run client`

Builds the client web page

#### `npm run start`

Runs the server

#### `npm run client-test`

Runs the Unit test
